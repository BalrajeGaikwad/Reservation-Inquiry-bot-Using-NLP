**ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Text Preprocessing & Simple Chatbot using NLTK**
This project focuses on building a basic text preprocessing pipeline and a simple rule-based chatbot using Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The goal is to demonstrate how natural language input can be cleaned, filtered, and structured for better understanding and response generation.

**ðŸ§  Key Concepts:**
- Text Preprocessing: The project includes common NLP preprocessing steps such as:
- Lowercasing text
- Removing punctuation
- Removing English stopwords and custom irrelevant words
- Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer
- Removing duplicate words

*Rule-based Chatbot:* The chatbot processes user input through the preprocessing function and matches it with pre-defined response patterns to provide meaningful replies.

**ðŸ’¬ Use Case:**
This system can serve as a base model for developing more complex NLP systems such as FAQ bots, customer service assistants, or domain-specific text classification tools.
